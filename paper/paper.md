## Abstract

Data Science - quite  a difficult term to technically define. However, the demand for data scientists is at an all time high. At the simplest level, it is the art of making sense from the never-ending sea of data - simple as that. To better unserstand this, we can think of developing a data mining model analogous to making a dish. You first scrape together the ingredients; this is our raw data. To improve the taste, you add a pinch of salt and other seasonings or spices; this is the creation of new predictor variables. Finally, you mix it all up together, and have  a taste. If it doesn't taste right, you might want to try a couple of other methods until you've perfected the recipe; analogy here referring to iteratively building descriptive (unsupervised) or predictive (supervised) models. And just like in the show Master Chef you often end up competing with other data scientists in developing the best possible recipe, or in this case the best model [@fa18-523-66-Discovering-datascience].

In the above example, just as how the chef needs his sharp knives, a data scientist needs the right tool. The top rated software being python, spark, R, Matlab to name a few. SAS Viya is the latest enhancement of the SAS platform. It is designed to address the new, and increasingly diverse, needs of organizations with methods, access, and deployment that scale to meet burgeoning analytics use cases. In the words of its developers:
>"SAS Viya addresses the complex analytical challenges of today, and effortlessly scales to meet your future needs, with cloud-enabled, elastic in-memory processing, in a high availability, multi-user environment [@fa18-523-66-SASViya-Special-Collection-5]".

## Introduction

SAS 9 brought with it a brilliant server-client web service model, all processes goverened by a resilient metadata server. It appeared to be the perfect platform for analytics, albeit a bit expensive. However, the advent of cloud computing blew the whole tech industry out of proportion. "SAS Viya brings a more resilient, elastic, unified, and accessible architecture, which leverages cloud-friendly microservices and a next generation analytics run-time engine [@fa18-523-66-SASViya-Special-Collection-1]". Thanks to its powerful and scalable capabilities, SAS Viya adds an additional value to the existing SAS deployment.

SAS Viya enables you to explore your data deeper, using the latest innovations in in-memory analytics. SAS is committed to delivering new, innovative data mining and machine learning algorithms that will scale to the size of your business, now and in the future". The methods available to users is classified in two: Data Wrangling methods and Modeling methods. Data wrangling methods include binning, transformations, SQL, clustering etc., while modelling techniques include everything from regression to text mining to neural networks. One of the prime features of using SAS for these methods is its innate ability to run all above-mentioned methods in-memory and of course take advantage of the parallel processing infrastructure [@fa18-523-66-SASViya-Special-Collection-4].

SAS Viya emphasises a unified experience for data scientists and analysts alike. The new cloud analytical platform, allows programmers to execute using laguages like Python, Java, and Lua. Furthermore, the platform also allows these codes to be written and executed on Jupyter notebooks. Obviously, SAS Viya offers something exciting for everyone [@fa18-523-66-SASViya-Special-Collection-3].
